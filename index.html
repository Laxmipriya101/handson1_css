    <ol class="list">
      <li>Css stands for Cascading style Sheets.</li>
      <li>
        Css describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or
        in other media.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span id="para1">Css is not neccesary</span>
        <span id="para2">Css save a lot of work.</span> It can control the
        layout of multiple web page all at once.
      </li>
      <li class="list4">
        <em>External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</em>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="head">CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="word-space">
      <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements 1</li>
      <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
      <li>
        External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.
      </li>
      <li>
        The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS
        files. However , <span id="para2">in this<br />
        tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier
        to demonstrate, and easier <br /> for you to try it yourself.</li>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class="para3">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applied a style to 
      one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript. </p>
    <p class="para3"> In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of element on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element </p>
    <p class="para3">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied .</p>
